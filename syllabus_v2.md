| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identification of Automation Opportunity** | Clearly identifies a specific, repetitive task or bottleneck within the consulting context that is highly suitable for workflow automation.     | Identifies a relevant task/bottleneck, but it may be somewhat vague, less repetitive, or only partially suitable for workflow automation.       | Fails to identify a suitable task/bottleneck, or the identified opportunity is inappropriate for workflow automation.      |
| **Justification of Suitability for LLM Workflow** | Provides a strong, logical explanation for *why* the identified task is a good candidate for LLM-powered automation, referencing its characteristics. | Provides some reasoning for suitability, but the justification may be weak, incomplete, or not clearly linked to LLM capabilities.             | Offers little to no justification, or the reasoning provided is flawed or irrelevant to LLM-based workflow potential.    |
| **Conception of Initial LLM Role**    | Clearly articulates logical initial ideas on *how* an LLM (using Week 1 concepts like Q&A/info retrieval) could contribute to streamlining the task. | Articulates some ideas on the LLM's role, but the connection to the task or Week 1 concepts might be unclear or less impactful.            | Fails to articulate a coherent role for the LLM, or the proposed use is inappropriate/misaligned with Week 1 concepts. |
| **Clarity and Professionalism**        | The analysis is well-organized, clearly written, concise, and presented professionally (e.g., appropriate format, free of significant errors).       | The analysis has minor clarity or organizational issues, or contains some grammatical errors, slightly impacting professional presentation. | The analysis is confusing, poorly organized, contains significant errors, or lacks professional presentation.       |

### Week 2: Simple Workflow Design

| **Criterion**                          | **Good (80-100%)**                                                                                                                               | **Fair (60-79%)**                                                                                                                               | **Bad (0-59%)**                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow Diagram Clarity & Accuracy** | The diagram clearly and accurately depicts a simple, linear workflow sequence, correctly indicating LLM steps and distinct conceptual tool calls. | The diagram depicts a workflow sequence but may have minor clarity issues, inaccuracies in step representation, or unclear LLM/tool distinctions. | The diagram is confusing, inaccurate, incomplete, or fails to represent a logical workflow sequence.                |
| **Logical Flow of Workflow**           | The designed workflow follows a logical and sensible sequence of steps to address the identified problem/opportunity from Week 1.                  | The workflow sequence is generally logical but may have minor inefficiencies, unnecessary steps, or slight inconsistencies in flow.            | The workflow sequence is illogical, inefficient, or does not adequately address the intended problem/opportunity. |
| **Appropriateness of Conceptual Tools** | The conceptual tools identified within the workflow are relevant, well-defined for their purpose, and appropriate for augmenting the LLM.           | Some conceptual tools are relevant, but others may be vaguely defined, inappropriate for the step, or missing where needed.                     | The conceptual tools identified are irrelevant, poorly defined, or largely missing from the workflow design.      |
| **Clarity and Strength of Justification** | The written justification clearly explains the workflow's logic and the purpose of each step with strong reasoning.                               | The justification explains the workflow but may lack depth, clarity in reasoning, or complete explanation for some steps.                         | The justification is unclear, illogical, incomplete, or fails to adequately explain the workflow design.         |

| **Application of Advanced Concepts & Patterns** | Effectively incorporates and correctly explains relevant Week 3 concepts (e.g., multi-step logic, decisions, chaining, patterns) enhancing the design appropriately. | Attempts to incorporate/explain advanced concepts/patterns, but integration may be superficial, slightly flawed, or some key relevant concepts might be missing or misused.             | Fails to incorporate/explain advanced concepts/patterns meaningfully, or the application/explanation is fundamentally flawed or inappropriate for the scenario. |
| **Workflow Diagram Clarity & Accuracy**  | The revised diagram is clear, accurately depicts the complex flow (including branches/loops), and correctly represents all key components (LLM, tools, decisions).         | The revised diagram shows a complex flow but may have minor clarity issues, inaccuracies in depicting branches/loops, or slight inconsistencies in component representation.           | The revised diagram is confusing, inaccurate, incomplete, or fails to represent the intended complex workflow logic.                                    |
| **Workflow Logic & Feasibility**       | The designed complex workflow follows a logical sequence, effectively addresses the problem, and appears conceptually feasible and coherent.                           | The workflow logic is generally sound but may have minor inconsistencies, inefficiencies, or aspects that slightly stretch conceptual feasibility or coherence.                          | The workflow logic is flawed, incoherent, inefficient, does not address the problem adequately, or seems conceptually infeasible.                          |
| **Risk Identification & Mitigation**   | Thoroughly identifies relevant potential risks/failure points and proposes specific, plausible, and well-reasoned mitigation strategies within the workflow context.     | Identifies some risks but may miss obvious ones, or the proposed mitigation strategies are generic, less plausible, or not well-integrated into the design.                         | Fails to identify significant risks, or the proposed mitigation strategies are irrelevant, implausible, ineffective, or missing.                           |

### Week 4: Workflow Proposal Package

| **Criterion**                          | **Good (80-100%)**                                                                                                                                                 | **Fair (60-79%)**                                                                                                                                         | **Bad (0-59%)**                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clarity of Problem & Solution**      | Clearly and concisely articulates the business problem and presents the final workflow solution (including core design elements) in an easily understandable manner. | Articulates the problem and solution, but may lack some clarity or conciseness; the workflow presentation might require minor clarification.               | Fails to clearly articulate the problem or the solution; the workflow presentation is confusing or significantly underdeveloped.                     |
| **Justification of Value & Impact (Benefits & KPIs)** | Effectively argues for the workflow's business value with specific benefits and proposes relevant, thoughtful KPIs or metrics to measure success.         | Communicates some benefits and proposes KPIs/metrics, but the value justification may lack specificity or strength, or KPIs might be generic or less relevant. | Fails to articulate clear benefits/value, or the connection to outcomes is weak; proposed KPIs/metrics are inappropriate, vague, or missing.        |
| **Risk, Ethics, & Limitation Analysis** | Provides a balanced, thoughtful discussion of key risks, relevant ethical considerations, and realistic limitations specific to the proposed workflow.                | Mentions risks, ethics, or limitations, but the discussion may lack depth, balance, or fail to address key specific considerations adequately.              | Ignores or inadequately addresses risks, ethical considerations, or limitations, presenting an overly optimistic or naive view of the proposal. |
| **Proposal Structure & Professionalism** | Proposal is well-structured, complete (covering key areas), professionally presented (clear, concise, error-free), and suitable for the target audience.        | Proposal structure is adequate and most key areas covered; minor issues with professionalism (e.g., typos, clarity) or slight mismatch for audience.    | Proposal structure is poor, key areas missing; lacks professionalism (significant errors, confusing), or unsuitable for the target audience.     |

### Participation and Professionalism

Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Course Policies

**Note Taking:** While watching the class lectures, make sure you take notes. A separate presentation file will be provided via *Blackboard* for you to take notes. In most of the lecture notebooks, there are exercise questions. You will need to submit exercise files after most classes. We will use a *buddy system* where students form 2-3 person groups for comparing notes and codes.

**Preparations:** To contribute to class discussions, you must spend adequate time prior to class preparing all required tasks (e.g., readings, assignments). This is **mandatory**!

**Respect and Dignity:** It is important for each of us to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (R&D). Listen carefully to questions and comments while keeping an open mind. It is okay to disagree, but present your arguments courteously. Negative body language, unprofessional comments, or interruptions are not acceptable.

**Professionalism:** Conduct yourself in a professional manner, as you would with an employer or colleague. Avoid unprofessional behaviors such as arriving late, leaving during class, or using mobile devices for non-class purposes. Only software tools required for the class are allowed during class time.
