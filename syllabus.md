### Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **Generative AI (GAI)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)**, focusing on their practical applications across various business sectors such as *Marketing*, *Human Resources*, and *Legal*. Students will learn to identify specific business problems that can be addressed using GAI/LLM technologies, evaluate different adoption strategies, and present solutions derived from these advanced tools.

Key topics include the fundamentals of GAI/LLM, techniques for fine-tuning models, and hands-on experience with no-code AI tools designed for business professionals. Students will engage in group discussions to explore relevant use cases and data requirements, followed by practical sessions where they will work with GAI/LLM artifacts tailored to their specific needs. The course culminates in a presentation of their findings to a panel of judges, providing valuable feedback and insights for real-world application.

## Course Materials

All materials used in this course, including but not limited to lecture recordings/notes, AI tools, and data files, will be distributed via **Blackboard**.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to:

- Associate specific business problems with on-premises GAI and LLM artifacts.
- Evaluate different adoption strategies for GAI and LLM artifacts in the context of specific business problems.
- Present solutions derived from adopted GAI and LLM artifacts for selected business challenges.
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of GAI/LLM implementations in business contexts.
- Develop a strategic plan for integrating GAI/LLM technologies into existing business processes.

### Participation and Professionalism

Given the large class enrollment and the technical nature of the subject, it is critical that everyone take a professional approach to learning the material. Students are expected to come to class prepared and then participate in all activities to the best of their abilities. Cheating, free-riding, and other unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated.

---

## Course Policies

**Note Taking:** While watching the class lectures, make sure you take notes. A separate presentation file will be provided via *Blackboard* for you to take notes. In most of the lecture notebooks, there are exercise questions. You will need to submit exercise files after most classes. We will use a *buddy system* where students form 2-3 person groups for comparing notes and codes.

**Preparations:** To contribute to class discussions, you must spend adequate time prior to class preparing all required tasks (e.g., readings, assignments). This is **mandatory**!

**Respect and Dignity:** It is important for each of us to respect each other. Treat your classmates with respect and dignity (R&D). Listen carefully to questions and comments while keeping an open mind. It is okay to disagree, but present your arguments courteously. Negative body language, unprofessional comments, or interruptions are not acceptable.

**Professionalism:** Conduct yourself in a professional manner, as you would with an employer or colleague. Avoid unprofessional behaviors such as arriving late, leaving during class, or using mobile devices for non-class purposes. Only software tools required for the class are allowed during class time.
