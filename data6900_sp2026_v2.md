## **Course Description**
This course provides a practical introduction to designing and implementing business process automation using Generative AI (GenAI). Students will learn to identify and analyze existing business workflows, conceptualize AI-driven solutions, and develop comprehensive proposals for automation. The curriculum is designed for a diverse graduate audience, focusing on strategic thinking and logical design rather than deep technical implementation. Through a semester-long project, students will select a real-world business case and build a complete automation proposal and a functional prototype, from initial opportunity analysis to a final executive-ready showcase.

## **Course Philosophy: The Consultant & The Teacher**
This course is built on two core philosophies that mirror the demands of the modern workplace:

1.  **You are a Consultant:** We focus on the *craft* of consulting. Our goal is to move beyond the technology to solve real business problems. You will learn to analyze processes, quantify value, manage risk, and communicate your recommendations with the poise and professionalism of a seasoned consultant.
2.  **You are the Teacher of an AI:** The best way to learn how to use AI is to learn how to *teach* it. In this course, you are not just a user of a tool; you are an instructor for a brilliant but naive digital mind. We will frame "prompt engineering" as **Lesson Planning for an AI**, treating its components as the "Student Persona," "Required Reading," and "The Assignment." Debugging becomes **Diagnosing the Misunderstanding**. This approach transforms technical challenges into exercises in logic, clarity, and communication.

## **Learning Objectives**
Upon successful completion of this course, you will have a portfolio of work that demonstrates you are a business-minded problem solver who can:

1.  **Analyze** complex business processes and identify high-value opportunities for AI-powered automation.
2.  **Design** robust, practical, and human-centric workflow solutions, instructing AI with clarity and precision.
3.  **Quantify** the potential business impact of a technical solution and articulate a compelling, data-driven case for change.
4.  **Execute** on your designs by rapidly building functional prototypes using modern, low-code automation platforms.
5.  **Communicate** your strategic recommendations and technical solutions with confidence, poise, and a strong narrative to a senior executive audience.

## **Course Format & Methodology**
This course uses a hands-on, project-based approach in a **flipped classroom** model.
*   **Pre-Class:** Students will watch pre-recorded lectures covering theoretical concepts and new tools.
*   **In-Class:** Class time is a **Consulting Workshop**. You will work in your project teams, applying the concepts from the lectures to your ongoing project. The instructor will act as a senior consultant, conducting "Consulting Rounds" with each team to provide personalized coaching, feedback, and occasional "Scenario Injections" to test your adaptability.
*   **Student-Led Learning:** In the second half of the course, teams will take turns leading technical presentations, teaching their peers key skills in the n8n automation platform.

## **Grading Rubrics**
Detailed rubrics will be provided for all major assignments. An example for the Student-Led Technical Presentation is provided below.

**Instructor Rubric: Student-Led Technical Presentation (Contributes 8%)**
| Criteria (Weight) | Excellent (4 pts) | Good (3 pts) | Satisfactory (2 pts) | Needs Improvement (1 pt) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Accuracy (40%)** | Concepts are explained flawlessly and with depth. Demo is perfectly executed. The team confidently and correctly answers all peer questions. | Concepts are explained correctly with only minor simplifications. Demo works as intended. The team answers most questions well. | Core concepts are correct, but some key details are fuzzy or slightly inaccurate. Demo has minor glitches but achieves its goal. Some questions are answered incorrectly. | There are significant errors in the technical explanation. Demo fails or does not illustrate the intended concept. The team is unable to answer most questions. |
| **Pedagogical Effectiveness (40%)** | The presentation is logically structured to maximize learning. Complex ideas are skillfully broken down. The demo is the perfect example for the concept. | The presentation has a clear, logical structure. The demo is relevant and helpful. The session connects the "how" (the skill) to the "why" (its use in the project). | The presentation structure is present but could be clearer. The demo is functional but a better example could have been chosen. Pacing is inconsistent. | The presentation is disorganized and hard to follow. The demo is confusing or disconnected from the core topic. The session does not facilitate peer learning. |
| **Preparation & Professionalism (20%)** | The presentation is well-rehearsed and delivered with confidence. Slides are professional, clear, and error-free. The team works together seamlessly and manages time perfectly. | The presentation is clearly rehearsed. Slides are well-designed with few to no errors. The team coordinates their efforts effectively. Time management is good. | The presentation feels under-rehearsed. Slides are functional but may be cluttered or contain errors. Coordination between team members is clunky. | The presentation is disorganized and read from notes. Slides are sloppy or unprofessional. Poor time management and lack of team coordination. |
