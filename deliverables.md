## Deliverable 1: Business Problem Diagnosis Report (Week 1)

### Part 1: Plan
The **plan** for the Business Problem Diagnosis Report focuses on identifying and analyzing a specific business problem that can be addressed using Generative AI (GAI) or Large Language Models (LLM). It includes:

- **Design:** Define the business problem with clear objectives, scope, and measurable outcomes (e.g., "Reduce customer churn by 15% in the telecom sector using LLM-driven sentiment analysis").
- **Development:** Outline a high-level strategy for applying GAI/LLM, such as using LLMs to analyze customer feedback or GAI to generate personalized marketing content. Identify key stages of analysis (inspired by CRISP-DM: business understanding, data understanding, etc.).
- **Implementation:** Propose a feasible approach within the four-week course duration, including initial steps like stakeholder interviews or data scoping, ensuring alignment with available resources.

**Example Plan Outline:**
- Problem: High customer churn in a subscription service.
- Objective: Improve retention through targeted interventions.
- Strategy: Use LLM to analyze customer support interactions and identify pain points.
- Steps: Conduct stakeholder interviews, scope initial data, and prioritize GAI/LLM use cases.

### Part 2: Prompts
The **prompts** provide actionable guidance for professionals, tech workers, or AI agents to refine the problem or explore GAI/LLM applications. These prompts are integrated into the report to demonstrate how to execute the plan.

**Example Prompts:**
- For AI Agents: "Analyze the following customer feedback dataset: [insert sample data]. Identify recurring themes and sentiment trends that could indicate churn risk."
- For Tech Workers: "Interview stakeholders with this question: 'What are the top three customer complaints you’ve noticed in the past six months?' Summarize findings and suggest how GAI could address them."
- For Professionals: "Given a business goal of reducing churn, brainstorm five ways LLMs could enhance customer experience. Rank them by feasibility."

## Deliverable 2: Data Strategy Report (Week 2)

### Part 1: Plan
The **plan** for the Data Strategy Report focuses on the strategic approach to data collection, compliance, and storage to support the GAI/LLM solution identified in Week 1. It includes:

- **Design:** Identify relevant data sources (e.g., customer reviews, transaction logs) and types (structured/unstructured) needed for the solution, justifying their relevance.
- **Development:** Detail compliance measures (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and risk management strategies, such as anonymizing sensitive data or securing access controls.
- **Implementation:** Recommend a storage solution (e.g., cloud-based database like AWS S3) with a timeline for setup, ensuring scalability, cost-efficiency, and security.

**Example Plan Outline:**
- Data Sources: Customer support tickets, social media mentions.
- Compliance: Encrypt PII, ensure opt-in consent for data use.
- Storage: Use AWS S3 with tiered access; implement by Week 3 for testing.

### Part 2: Prompts
The **prompts** guide AI agents or tech workers in executing the data strategy, ensuring practical application of the plan.

**Example Prompts:**
- For AI Agents: "Given a dataset of customer support tickets, classify entries containing personal information and suggest anonymization techniques compliant with GDPR."
- For Tech Workers: "Evaluate three cloud storage options (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob). Provide a cost-benefit analysis based on scalability and security."
- For Professionals: "List potential data sources for customer sentiment analysis. Rank them by accessibility and relevance to the churn problem."

## Deliverable 3: Solution Design and Implementation Plan (Week 3)

### Part 1: Plan
The **plan** for the Solution Design and Implementation Plan outlines the GAI/LLM solution’s technical and operational framework. It includes:

- **Design:** Select tools/technologies (e.g., Hugging Face for LLMs, no-code platforms like Bubble) with justification based on the problem and constraints.
- **Development:** Estimate resources (e.g., compute costs, team hours) and perform a cost analysis to ensure feasibility.
- **Implementation:** Provide a phased roadmap with milestones (e.g., Week 3: Prototype LLM model; Week 4: Test outputs), ensuring alignment with the course timeline.

**Example Plan Outline:**
- Tool: Fine-tuned BERT model via Hugging Face.
- Resources: $50 cloud credits, 10 hours of tech support.
- Roadmap: Week 3 – Model training; Week 4 – Integration into customer support workflow.

### Part 2: Prompts
The **prompts** assist AI agents or tech workers in executing the design and implementation, offering clear guidance.

**Example Prompts:**
- For AI Agents: "Using the dataset from Week 2, fine-tune a BERT model to predict churn risk. Output accuracy metrics and top feature insights."
- For Tech Workers: "Compare Hugging Face and OpenAI APIs for cost and performance on a sentiment analysis task. Recommend one with reasoning."
- For Professionals: "Draft a timeline for deploying an LLM solution in a customer support team. Include at least three milestones."

## Deliverable 4: Board-Level Presentation System (Week 4)

### Part 1: Plan
The **plan** for the Board-Level Presentation System summarizes the strategic approach and its business impact, tailored for executive stakeholders. It includes:

- **Design:** Summarize the solution (e.g., LLM-driven churn prediction) and its benefits (e.g., 20% churn reduction), focusing on clarity and business relevance.
- **Development:** Outline the creation of presentation materials, including visuals (charts, graphs) and a narrative linking the plan to ROI.
- **Implementation:** Plan the delivery (e.g., 10-minute Zoom presentation) with a rehearsal schedule and feedback incorporation.

**Example Plan Outline:**
- Summary: LLM predicts churn, saves $500K annually.
- Materials: Bar chart of churn trends, cost-benefit table.
- Delivery: Present to judges on Week 4, Day 1; rehearse Day 0.

### Part 2: Prompts
The **prompts** guide AI tools or tech workers in refining the presentation, ensuring professional polish.

**Example Prompts:**
- For AI Agents: "Generate a concise executive summary (100 words) based on this solution: [insert solution details]. Highlight ROI and key benefits."
- For Tech Workers: "Create a bar chart comparing churn rates before and after LLM implementation using this data: [insert sample data]."
- For Professionals: "Refine this slide narrative: 'Our LLM solution reduces churn by 20%.' Add two supporting points for a board audience."


This structure ensures students not only devise robust strategies but also learn to leverage AI and human expertise effectively, meeting the query’s requirements comprehensively.
