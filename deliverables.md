# Deliverables

## Week 1: Foundations - LLMs, Augmentation, and Workflows

This week focuses on understanding the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs), how they can be augmented with tools and context, the difference between structured workflows and autonomous agents, and identifying potential automation opportunities in a consulting context.

**Deliverable:**
*   A short written analysis (e.g., 1-2 pages or equivalent slide deck) identifying a specific, repetitive task or bottleneck within a provided consulting scenario (or one from student experience) suitable for potential automation using an LLM-powered workflow.
*   Include initial thoughts on how an LLM could contribute to solving or streamlining this task, based on the concepts of basic Q&A or information retrieval discussed.

## Week 2: Building Blocks & Simple Workflow Design

Building on Week 1, this week dives into the core components needed for workflows (LLM, Tools, Context, Orchestration) and focuses on designing simple, linear sequences using conceptual tool calls. Students practice visualizing these workflows.

**Deliverable:**
*   A visual diagram (using tools like Miro, Lucidchart, PowerPoint, or even neatly hand-drawn and scanned) illustrating a simple, single-path workflow designed to address the opportunity identified in Week 1 (or a provided alternative).
*   The diagram should clearly show the sequence of steps, indicating where the LLM operates and where conceptual "Tools" (like 'Search Database', 'Draft Email') would be invoked.
*   A brief written justification (e.g., half a page) explaining the logic of the workflow sequence and the purpose of each step.

## Week 3: Advanced Patterns & Workflow Resilience

This week introduces more complex workflow structures, including multi-step processes, prompt chaining, handling errors, incorporating user choices, and considering feasibility. Students will evolve their simple workflow designs.

**Deliverable:**
*   An updated and more detailed workflow design document for the scenario addressed in Week 2, incorporating concepts from Week 3. This document should include:
    *   A revised visual diagram showing a multi-step workflow, potentially including decision points, loops (for retries or refinement), or points for user interaction.
    *   A description of the workflow, explicitly mentioning patterns used (e.g., sequence, conceptual tool use, prompt chaining, user choice points).
    *   A section discussing potential risks or failure points in the workflow (e.g., ambiguous input, tool failure, inaccurate LLM output) and proposed mitigation strategies (e.g., adding validation steps, fallback procedures, self-correction prompts).

## Week 4: Evaluation, Implementation & Client Communication

The final week focuses on assessing the value and effectiveness of the designed workflow, considering practical and ethical aspects, and communicating the solution to stakeholders. It synthesizes the work from previous weeks into a final package.

**Deliverable:**
*   A final "Workflow Proposal Package," presented as if for a client or internal manager. This could be a slide deck (e.g., 5-10 slides) or a concise report (e.g., 3-4 pages) that includes:
    *   A brief summary of the problem/opportunity.
    *   The final workflow diagram and description (refined from Week 3).
    *   Key benefits and expected value (e.g., efficiency gains, improved consistency).
    *   A discussion of evaluation metrics (how success would be measured).
    *   Mention of key risks, ethical considerations, and limitations.
    *   Brief notes on potential next steps (e.g., pilot testing, low-code implementation considerations).
    *   A brief mention of future possibilities, potentially including agent-based approaches, positioning them relative to the proposed workflow.
